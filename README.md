## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jason Zheng, a current graduate student at Boston University for Data Science.

I am interested in Data Science and Machine Learning.

One of my recent projects involved building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify 5 groups of images. They were trained in Google Colab on a dataset with 22,500 images, which were augmented with Keras' ImageDataGenerator and trained with TensorFlow. We ended up with a test accuracy of 92.4% after extensive training on a VGG inspired architecture.

In my free time, I play video games such as League of Legends and TFT. I also have experience as a varsity collegiate player in League.
